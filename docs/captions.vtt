00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.167
Imagine this.

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.434
You're driving your dream car.

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:05.433
But then the unexpected happens.

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:09.001
Hello.
I'm here to talk about something
important.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.468
Gap insurance.

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:13.934
Let's
check out a real life scenario.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.835
When you're paying off a car
loan or lease,

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.468
your car's value can be less
than what you owe.

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:21.935
This is where gap insurance
comes into play.

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:24.701
Gap insurance
helps you in case your car's
totaled in an accident.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.768
It covers the gap between what
you owe on your loan or lease

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:30.101
and the actual value
of your car.

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.368
And that's gap insurance.

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:34.667
