        <div class="text"><p>This project was made for a local insurance company. It is a proof-of-concept on how to explain commonly confused terms relating to insurance. In the example video, the term "Gap Insurance" is explained in a simple manner in order to adhere to different kinds of consumers that need more information on insurance.</p></div>
        <div class="header2"><h2>About the Process</h2></div>
        <div class="text"><p>The script for the video was written by Min Wu, while the video was animated, voiced, and edited by Tyler Akam. Tyler began his work by making assets in Adobe Illustrator, then continued by animating them in separate compositions in Adobe After Effects, then finally editing it all together in Adobe Premiere Pro. The royalty-free background music was sourced from YouTube Audio Library. The splash page for the website was made by Min Wu, while this about page was made by Tyler Akam.
